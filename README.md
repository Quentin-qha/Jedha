## 👋 Introduction
My name is Quentin, and I am currently transitioning into data science after 8 years in product design.  
This repository gathers all the projects I've worked on during my bootcamp at Jedha.

My goal is to become a data scientist.


## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository
This repository is meant to:
- Centralize all my training projects (data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, etc.)
- Showcase my learning progress
- Share my work with recruiters, mentors, or peers


## 📈 Learning Roadmap
